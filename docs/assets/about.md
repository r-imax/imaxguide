# About This Site

## Brief History

A list was previously available on Wikipedia, but was removed by other editors in a policy disagreement. The last snapshot of that page is available here: [List of IMAX Venues (as of May 5th 2024)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240505001340/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IMAX_venues)

If you'd like the XML Export, a copy from May 1st 2024 is available here: [Wikipedia-20240501181526.xml](https://github.com/r-imax/r-imax-original/blob/main/docs/exports/Wikipedia-20240501181526.xml).

## Why create this site?

This site exists to provide a consolidated place to hold the lists, freely accessible, without ads. I wanted to make it more useful by adding sorting options, and more features will come in the future. There is also a Wiki planned for a future theatre directory, as well as including Xenon screens in a separate list.

## Where can I find the source files?

The code and CommonMark files used to generate this site are available on GitHub: [imaxguide](https://github.com/r-imax/imaxguide).

## How can I help?

Suggestions and corrections are always accepted. You can reach me on Reddit ([u/anthonylavado](https://www.reddit.com/user/anthonylavado/)), Mastodon ([@anthonylavado:social.bonifacelabs.ca](https://social.bonifacelabs.ca/@anthonylavado)), or by e-mail (admin [AT] 143190.xyz).

A lot has changed since May. I'll need help updating it all.

Thanks,
Anthony
