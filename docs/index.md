# Welcome to the IMAX Guide

This website works as a directory of known IMAXÂ® screens around the world, with a focus on Laser and 15/70 film projection.

Begin by choosing a region from the list.

If your theatre isn't listed, this likely means that they are using IMAX Digital (Xenon) projectors. These will be added at a later time.

If you have updated information, see "[How Can I Help?](https://143190.xyz/about/#how-can-i-help)".

Need help understanding **projector names and types**? See [Projector Information](projectorinformation.md).
