# Understanding Projector Names

## IMAX Digital
There are four common types of IMAX digital projectors. Three of them are referred to as IMAX with Laser.

### IMAX GT Laser

- Also known as: GT Dual Laser, Dual Laser, DL2.
- Maximum Aspect Ratio: 1.43:1 (true IMAX)
- Light Type: Laser
- Number of Projectors: 2
- Resolution per projector: DCI 4K
- Speaker System: IMAX 12.0 (12-channel sound)

The best of the best (in digital). The only IMAX with Laser system to project on screens in the full IMAX size. Some larger screens in the 1.90:1 size may use GT Laser if they are above a certain width. In rare cases, this may be installed next to a working 15/70mm IMAX film projection system.

### IMAX Commercial Laser

- Also known as: CoLa, IMAX with Laser, Single Laser
- Maximum Aspect Ratio: 1.90:1 (IMAX Digital)
- Light Type: Laser
- Number of Projectors: 1
- Resolution per projector: DCI 4K
- Speaker System: IMAX 12.0 (12-channel sound)

The best of the rest. The flagship of the IMAX Single Laser series, used at many screens worldwide. In at least one case, this is installed next to a working 15/70mm IMAX film projection system.

### IMAX Laser XT

- Also known as: XT Laser, XT
- Maximum Aspect Ratio: 1.90:1 (IMAX Digital)
- Light Type: Laser
- Number of Projectors: 1
- Resolution per projector: DCI 4K
- Speaker System: IMAX 12.0 (12-channel sound), or IMAX 5.0 (5-channel sound)

The latest model of single laser projector. Typically used in refurbishments to existing screens with older IMAX Digital (Xenon) systems. For new installs, it is typically paired with the newer IMAX 12.0 sound system. When replacing an older install, there is the option to upgrade to IMAX 12.0, or stay on the older IMAX 5.0 system.

### IMAX Digital

- Also known as: Xenon, Dual Xenon
- Maximum Aspect Ratio: 1.90:1 (IMAX Digital)
- Light Type: Xenon Lamp
- Number of Projectors: 2
- Resolution per projector: DCI 2K
- Speaker System: IMAX 5.0 (5-channel sound) or IMAX 6.0 (6-channel sound)

The oldest model of digital projector. The Xenon system projects at a lower quality compared to the laser systems. Since it uses convetional light instead of laser illumination, it may not have the same maximum brightness as any of the laser solutions. Laser will provide better contrast compared to Xenon. Typically this system is used in older IMAX installations. It is often a replacement for GT/SR theatres that formerly had 15/70mm film projection. In theatres that still retain their film projectors, the IMAX Digital system is used for a wide variety of regular screenings.
