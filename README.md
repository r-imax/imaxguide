# Welcome to the IMAX Guide

This website works as a directory of known IMAXÂ® screens around the world, with a focus on Laser and 15/70 film projection.

It's built using a set of CSVs to provide the data, along with a Python script that converts measurements from Metric to US Imperial. It is then built using MKDocs with the Material for MKDocs theme.

The site itself lives on Github Pages at https://143190.xyz.
